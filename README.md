# Overview

In this repo, I'll be putting some Modal apps that leverage open source models for things like music generation, image generation, and more.

I'll be using [Modal](https://modal.com/) to run the code, which is a platform for running Python code in the cloud. Great for ML / AI scripts as it lets you pick and run your code on GPUs, CPUs, or both. You can configure the resources you need by function, and it's billed by the second.

You can learn more about it [here](https://modal.com/), or read [this longer description](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-would-you-describe-what-mo-yz.2mCMLTvy3kQkO_JOdAA) created by Perplexity when I asked it to describe the Modal platform.
